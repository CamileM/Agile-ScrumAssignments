## I want to see draft of the topics and what things you are including in there:

  - Graduated from Brunel University with a Computer Science degree in the year 2018.
  - Was unable to secure a graduate scheme so I took the opportunity to work in retail
  for over year as I was financially unstable and needed an income.

  by pursuing to get a career in the IT industry.

## Key strength and weakness according to START

Strength:

   - Can work well in teams to achieve the same goal.
   - Confident in my ability and able to simply my knowledge to another colleagues
   to their understanding.
   - strong leadership skills.

  Experience working in (Swatch) using the STAR method.

  Weakness:

  - Struggling to understand new information or topic straight away.
    For instance, a topic at Sparta. I'll stay after 17:00 to complete as much as
    I can in the office so once I get home I can take in the information and
    meditate around it.

## How DevOps and Agile work together?

-  DevOps brings a team together by focusing on testing the software while Agile
mostly focuses on the constant changes that needed by made, based on the demands
from the Product Owner. They work well together because they mostly focuses on
task being completed within a group of people from different sectors or departments.
Everyone is coming together to complete a project.
