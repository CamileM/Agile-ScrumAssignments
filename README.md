Origins Of Agile

Software Developers in the 80s and 90s experienced high levels of failed projects & noticed some common traits:
- Too much analysis upfront
- Restrictive change control
- Too much uncertainty

Software developers collaborated and experimented with new ways of working.
They took the sucessful ideas and wrote down a set of underlying values in principles

The Agile Manifesto
- Individuals & interactions over process and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contracted negotiations
- Responding to change over following a plan

The Agile 12 Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile process harness change Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals.

6. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.


The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximising the amount of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
